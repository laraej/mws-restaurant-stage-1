## Install and run

1. First step is to clone this repository. On terminal go to directory where you want to have the clone and run:

`git clone https://github.com/laraej/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git`

2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site on a browser at this address: 

`http://localhost:8000`
